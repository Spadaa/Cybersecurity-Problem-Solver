# Cybersecurity-Problem-Solver

All details about the project are explained in the documentation.
I am considering improving some of the tools used in this project to enable real-time traffic analysis, incorporating AI to detect and block these common attack patterns automatically

# Summary
This project is structured in five key phases, each designed to enhance the network security system:
3.1. Data Analysis
In this phase, I analyzed the provided network traffic data to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential security risks. The goal was to thoroughly understand the traffic and areas that need attention.
3.2. Risk Identification and Policy Development
Based on the data analysis, I identified the main security risks and developed a comprehensive security policy. The policy was crafted to address these risks by defining preventive and corrective measures.
3.3. Implementation
This phase involved implementing a solution that enforces the security policy. A script  was created to simulate how the policy would assess and filter network traffic, ensuring adaptability to various traffic patterns.
3.4. Explanation and Documentation
I provided detailed explanations of the approach taken, documenting the analysis process, risk identification, and policy development. This phase highlights the thought process behind the solutions and innovations.
3.5. Innovation
In the final phase, I focused on creating a graphical interface that allows users to view the data collected in phase 3.3 in a more user-friendly and visually enhanced manner.
